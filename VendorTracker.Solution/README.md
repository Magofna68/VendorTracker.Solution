# Vendor Tracker Solution

#### By _**Brandon Magofna**_

## Description

_This is my independent project for week 9 at Epicodus. This application will alow the user to add vendors to a list, and orders to each vendor. Users are able to navigate the application and add/view all of the inputs they desire._

### Software Requirements

1. Internet browser
2. A code editor like VS Code or Atom to view or edit the codebase.
3. Installation of Razor

### Installation

1. Navigate to github repo to clone and click on the green 'code' button
2. Copy the URL and run 'git clone [copied URL] in a directory on your computer
3. Open with your preferred text editor to view the code base
4. Get project in functional order by running 'dotnet restore' to restore files
5. Run 'dotnet build' to enter app.
6. When ready, navigate to core project directory or project directory tests to run 'dotnet test' and 'dotnet run'  (this will need to be done within the project root folder or test root folder as the computer will need access to a .csproj file)
